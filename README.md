WireGuard installer for Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora. This script automates the installation and configuration of a WireGuard VPN server in just a few minutes.

## Features

- Automated WireGuard server installation and configuration
- Docker-based deployment for enhanced isolation
- Comprehensive peer management system
- Mobile and desktop client support
- Automatic updates and security patches
- Built-in logging and monitoring
- Secure configuration with automatic backups
- IPv4 and IPv6 support
- Automated firewall configuration
- Backup and restore functionality

## Usage

First, get the script and make it executable:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taimurey/wireguard-install.git
cd wireguard-install
chmod +x wireguard-manager.sh
```

Then run it:

```bash
sudo ./wireguard-manager.sh
```

You need to run the script as root and have Docker installed (the script will install it if missing).

The first time you run it, you'll have to:

1. Create an admin user
2. Set up initial configuration
3. Choose number of peer configurations to create

When WireGuard is installed, you can run the script again, and you will get the choice to:

- Add a new peer
- Revoke existing peer
- Remove WireGuard
- Exit

Client configuration files are stored in `/opt/wireguard-server/config/peer[X]/peer[X].conf`.

## Compatibility

The script supports these Linux distributions:

| Distribution    | Support |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Ubuntu >= 22.04 | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| Debian >= 11    | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |
| Fedora >= 39    | âœ… ðŸ¤–   |

Notes:

- The script is regularly tested against distributions marked with ðŸ¤–
- Only `amd64` architecture is officially supported
- The script requires `systemd` and `docker`
